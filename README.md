# WORKOUT TRACKER

### PURPOSE:
This fitness tracker app uses a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and Express routes. A user can create, view and track daily workouts. They can log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. They can also track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, it is possible to track the distance traveled.  Users will reach their goals more quickly if they are able to track the progress of their workouts.
